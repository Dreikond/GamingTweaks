## Custom ISOs
This is such a important move, **TL;DR** this will make `50%` of work done. This is also hard to do professionally, so choose your ISO wisely. Removing/stripping too much cause more issues and incompatibility and doesnt help with performance or speed.

[*Learn more about them in Revision discord/community.*](https://discordapp.com/invite/CCxWegZ)

**Note:** Installing them in MBR or GPT might give you different feels ingame. Experiment between with those two options<br/>
If you play games at any windowed mode, use Windows 7 or you will have to deal with DWM. <br/>
Windows 7 is by far the best for performance, but you can wisely pick and tweak newer versions as well.<br/>

## Windows Timers
After Windows 10 1809+, we have a forced synthetic QPC timer of 10mhz, <br/>
If you want to change Windows Timers to possibily "better" ones, you need use older windows versions.<br/> 
Windows timers are a complex topic. There are different types and results may vary.

ACPI PMT is a highly stable high frequency clock, it doesn't sync, because it is not set to a fixed heartbeat. It is frequency based, which means that it will never delay another tick from happening. This can eliminate the chance of having stutters.

HPET is highly stable high frequency clock, but it is programmed to be synced tightly, since it is set to tick every x amount of time, regardless of hardware configuration. HPET would be good if all cores ticked at the exact same speed and were naturally synced, but that is something that rarely ever happens which is why it is bad for so many people. HPET is a hardware based, synthetic timer.

On the other hand, TSC timer is also proven to be consistently good enough. It is the Windows default timer. I suggest experimenting and chosing a timer based on which feels best for you.

**For ACPI PMT (HPET OFF IN BIOS):**

`bcdedit /set disabledynamictick no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformclock yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes` <br/>

**For HPET (HPET ON in BIOS):**

`bcdedit /set disabledynamictick no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformclock yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformtick yes` <br/>

**For TSC (HPET ON/OFF IN BIOS):**

`bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformclock no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set useplatformtick no` <br/>

**Install SetTimerResolutionService**

This service increases the resolution of the Windows kernel timer, which will significantly lower latency.<br/>
Drop this file in C:/ folder, the file must be there to service work <br/>
Open command promt and paste: <br/>

`cd C:/` <br/>
`SetTimerResolutionService -install` <br/>

[Download SetTimerResolutionService](files/SetTimerResolutionService.exe)

**You can optionally paste those commands for system improvement,**

`bcdedit /set bootmenupolicy standard` <br/>
`bcdedit /set bootux disabled` <br/>
`bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off` <br/>
`bcdedit /set nx optout` <br/>
`bcdedit /set quietboot yes` <br/>
`bcdedit /set tpmbootentropy forcedisable` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000067 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000068 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /set {globalsettings} custom:16000069 true` <br/>
`bcdedit /timeout 0` <br/>
`bcdedit /set uselegacyapicmode no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set usefirmwarepcisettings no` <br/>
`bcdedit /set tscsyncpolicy Legacy` <br/>
`bcdedit /set x2apicpolicy enable` <br/>

If you still see stuttering/problems, you can try changing HPET (BIOS) to ON/OFF. Default is ON

## MSI-Mode

MSI is Message Signaled-Based Interrupts, a faster and better method that replaces Windows Line-Based interrupt mode. <br/>
Some drivers default to using legacy pin-triggered interrupts, which are now emulated and are slower than using MSI.

**Only set sata if you have sure its compatible, if you set it wrong you will BSOD** <br/>
**KILLER Ethernet cards are reported to be bad with MSI-mode**

![MSI](/img/msi1.png)<br/>

Changing the values of PCI ISA Bridge and PCI CPU Host with the Interrupt Affinity Policy tool will make them appear in the list if you want. Simple set and unset affinities.

[*Read more Windows Line Based vs MSI Based.*](https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/windows-line-based-vs-message-signaled-based-interrupts-msi-tool.378044/)

## Affinity Policy Tool

This tool sets affinity for a driverâ€™s interrupts, <br/>
Using only one CPU affinity for usb and gpu can yield improvements in performance and responsiveness

**Mouse device and correspondent USB controler/hub to one single CPU (I use CPU1)** <br/>
**GPU and correspondent PCI to a different one single CPU (I use CPU3)**

##  Process Scheduling
**TL;DR** of what is Win32Priority:

is the amount of time the Windows process scheduler allocates to a program. Short quantum will improve responsiveness at the expense of more context switching, or switching between tasks, which is computationally expensive. Long quantum will improve performance of programs at the expense of lower responsiveness. Why would you want long quantum, then? Well, it minimizes context switching and will make the game run smoother, resulting in better consistency when aiming. However, short quantum could potentially decrease input lag which would improve consistency as well. The higher the boost, the better the FPS and smoothness will be, but you may experience degraded input response with high boost. Generally, long quantum results in better smoothness but slightly degraded mouse response, whereas the opposite is true for short quantum. <br/>

**42 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, High foreground boost. 2A Hex<br/>
**41 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 29 Hex<br/>
**40 Decimal** = Short, Fixed, No foreground boost. 28 Hex<br/>
**38 Decimal** = Short, Variable, High foreground boost. 26 Hex<br/>
**37 Decimal** = Short, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 25 Hex<br/>
**36 Decimal** = Short, Variable, No foreground boost. 24 Hex<br/>
**26 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, High foreground boost. 1A Hex<br/>
**25 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, Medium foreground boost. 19 Hex<br/>
**24 Decimal** = Long, Fixed, No foreground boost. 18 Hex<br/>
**22 Decimal** = Long, Variable, High foreground boost. 16 Hex<br/>
**21 Decimal** = Long, Variable, Medium foreground boost. 15 Hex<br/>
**20 Decimal** = Long, Variable, No foreground boost. 14 Hex<br/>

**Try to understand the values, try to test the values, choose your desired value.**<br/>
I will no more recommend a single value, i can barely feel difference, tests in latency barely prove anything.<br/>
But seems like those values are the ones people like more: 42, 37, 26, 22, 16 <br/>

**To set Win32PrioritySeparation to 42 Decimal (2A Hex), paste this to Command Promt:**

`reg add "hklm\system\controlset001\control\prioritycontrol" /v win32priorityseparation /t reg_dword /d 00000042 /f`

**To set Win32PrioritySeparation to 22 Decimal (16 Hex), paste this to Command Promt:**

`reg add "hklm\system\controlset001\control\prioritycontrol" /v win32priorityseparation /t reg_dword /d 00000022 /f`
